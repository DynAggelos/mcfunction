It has a *very* competent autocomplete+ provider that is almost identical to Minecraft's native tab completions, so you will feel right at home. Includes functionality for Minecraft 13.* release.

### Options
* Enable Mincraft ID Prefix ("mincraft:" before IDs for blocks, entities, enchantments, etc.)
